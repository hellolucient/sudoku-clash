# Sound Files

Place the following sound files in this directory:

- place.mp3 - Sound when a tile is placed correctly
- invalid.mp3 - Sound when a tile is placed incorrectly
- complete.mp3 - Sound when a box is completed
- bonus.mp3 - Sound when a row or column is completed
- game-over.mp3 - Sound when the game ends
- select.mp3 - Sound when a cell is selected
- draw.mp3 - Sound when a tile is drawn

## Temporary Solution

Until you add real sound files, the game will use programmatically generated sounds as placeholders. These are simple tones created with the Web Audio API.

## File Format

MP3 is recommended for broad browser compatibility, but WAV and OGG formats are also supported in most modern browsers.
