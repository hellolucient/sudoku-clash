# Sudoku Clash - Game Rules and How to Play

Sudoku Clash is a competitive twist on the classic Sudoku puzzle, where you compete against the computer using a tile-placement mechanic similar to games like Scrabble or Word Cookies.

## Game Overview

In Sudoku Clash, you and the computer take turns placing numbered tiles on a Sudoku board. Unlike traditional Sudoku where you fill in all numbers yourself, here you:

1. Work with a limited set of tiles in your hand
2. Score points based on correct placements
3. Earn bonus points for completing rows, columns, and 3x3 boxes
4. Compete against a computer opponent

## How to Play

### Game Setup

1. **Choose Difficulty**: Select Easy, Medium, or Hard at the start screen
   - Easy: More pre-filled cells make the game more straightforward
   - Medium: Balanced challenge
   - Hard: Fewer pre-filled cells for a greater challenge

2. **Starting the Game**: 
   - The board is partially filled with "golden" number tiles
   - You receive 7 random tiles in your hand
   - The computer receives 7 tiles (hidden from you)

### Gameplay

1. **Your Turn**:
   - First, select an empty cell on the board
   - Then, select a tile from your hand to place in that cell
   - If your placement is valid according to Sudoku rules, you'll earn points
   - If invalid, you'll lose points and the tile will be returned to the pool (or given to your opponent if the pool is empty)

2. **Computer's Turn**:
   - The computer will show which cell it's selecting by highlighting it
   - After a brief pause, it will place one of its tiles
   - The computer follows the same rules as you

3. **Ongoing Play**:
   - After placing a tile, you'll automatically draw a new one from the pool (if available)
   - Play continues until the board is full or no more valid moves can be made

## Scoring System

- **Correct Placement**: Earn points equal to the number on the tile (1-9 points)
- **Incorrect Placement**: Lose 10 points
- **Row Completion**: +25 bonus points
- **Column Completion**: +25 bonus points
- **Box Completion**: +50 bonus points

## Winning the Game

The player with the highest score at the end of the game wins. The game ends when:
- The Sudoku board is completely filled
- Both players have no more tiles and the pool is empty
- There are no more valid moves possible

## Game Features

### Visual Indicators

- **Selected Cell**: When you select a cell, it's highlighted with a golden border
- **Computer's Selected Cell**: The computer's selection is highlighted in coral
- **Invalid Placement**: Shows a flashing animation in red
- **Completed Section**: Cells in completed rows, columns, or boxes animate briefly
- **Floating Points**: Points earned or lost appear as floating numbers

### Sound Effects

The game includes sound effects for:
- Selecting cells
- Placing tiles (valid and invalid)
- Completing rows, columns, and boxes
- Drawing new tiles
- Game over

## Strategy Tips

1. **Prioritize High-Value Tiles**: When possible, place higher number tiles (7-9) to earn more points.

2. **Look for Completion Opportunities**: Try to complete rows, columns, or boxes for substantial bonus points.

3. **Block the Computer**: If you notice the computer is close to completing a section, try to block it by placing a tile in that section first.

4. **Plan Ahead**: Look for cells that have few possible valid numbers and prioritize those to avoid getting stuck.

5. **Use Process of Elimination**: Standard Sudoku strategies apply - if a number can only go in one place in a row, column, or box, place it there.

6. **Watch Your Opponent's Hand Size**: The game shows how many tiles the computer has - if it's running low, you might want to focus on maximizing your own score rather than blocking.

## Difficulty Levels Explained

- **Easy**: 40 pre-filled cells, giving you more guidance and fewer decisions
- **Medium**: 30 pre-filled cells, offering a balanced challenge
- **Hard**: 20 pre-filled cells, requiring more strategic thinking and planning
